        | Hello World! Iâ€™m Michelle, a full stack web developer and software engineer currently in Portland, Oregon. Nothing excites me more than immersing myself in a good challenge or a great book. When not coding, I am most likely spending my time on some sort of creative project, getting involved in the local tech community, or exploring the world around me with my trusty Nikon camera.
