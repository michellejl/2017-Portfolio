        h2.title Girl Friend Factor
        img(src="images/portfolio/gff.png")
        p.description Freelance project for a non-profit. They had an older site that wasn't maintainable anymore. It also was not mobile friendly, and looked out-dated. I suggested a move to WordPress as an easy system for them to be able to manage their own content and then set about designing and building the site. Following launch of this project, I spent time training board members on how to actually use the new site. I continue to perform maintenance and other updates.

        p.description A simple game created with JavaScript on an HTML5 canvas element. This project required me to really spend some time wrapping my head around object-oriented-programming. I definitely feel I gained a much better understanding of the concept through building this project.
